Web service update assignment plugin for Moodle 2.X
------------------------------------------

We're trying to implement Moodle web-service for apdating assignment text. We're basing on a source code with template plugin found in [moodle-local_wstemplate](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-local_wstemplate).

To test:
1- install the plugin in moodle/local/ws_assign/
2- Read, setup and run [client](https://github.com/ulysses4ever/moodle-assignment-client).
